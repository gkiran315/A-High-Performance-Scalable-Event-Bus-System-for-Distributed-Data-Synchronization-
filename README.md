# A-High-Performance-Scalable-Event-Bus-System-for-Distributed-Data-Synchronization

**_Biref Description about the Project:_**
I have implemented the first project using Java Websockets. Basically In this project, I have designed an event bus system which combines the pub-sub system with message queue technology. I have implemented the pub-sub system using web-sockets that is what stands out from other pub-sub systems. I have also synchronized the message delivery between the publisher-event bus-subscriber using Avro. Most importantly, I have implemented the scalability by transferring the messages onto a different event bus whenever the messages in the first event bus reaches the threshold limit, thereby balancing the load of the event bus.
